# ConvoLibre OS
Giving sudo access to chatbot personalities, a web server cooperative based on conversation. Hooking in a natural language dialog engine into a shell. If you know the bash language, you are free to instruct the machine that way, but if you prefer to use English, Convolos is a conversational agent that can perform tasks on your behalf.

A server may be configured such that unpriveledged identities must request tasks through the chatbot personality, which will perform priveleged tasks according to its dialog script. 

### ConvoLOS for short
Convolos, by happenstance, is almost latin for: "Fly or Flock Together"
